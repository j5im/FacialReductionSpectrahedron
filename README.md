# Facial Reduction Spectrahedron

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the facial reduction code for standard spectrahedra. 

(1) main.m is used to load an instance and call the facial reduction algorithm. 

(2) There are two instances provided in the 'data' folder. 

(3) The 'src' folder contains the facial reduction algorithm.

(4) 'Construction and Explanation of the Facial Reduction Algorithm.pdf' is included to explain the construction and implementation of the algorithm.
